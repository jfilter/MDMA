Based on [this template](https://github.com/skorokithakis/django-project-template) and followed [this guide](https://www.stavros.io/posts/deploy-django-dokku/) to deploy it with [Dokku](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/).

Here is the Django project where people can view and uploaded images. The style transform happens at another server: <https://github.com/jfilter/MDMA-style-transfer>
